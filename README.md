This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that was used to predict 'the average damage inflicted in PUBG game by the player' based on several details provided. The dataset used is a subset of the original PUBG dataset available in Kaggle.

In the game PUBG, good players can easily be correlated with their average damage in a given match.
We have taken into consideration following factors:
1. Average kill distance
2. Average survival time
3. Average ping rate
4. Total travel distance (averaged over games played)

The parameter we wish to predict is:
1. The average damage inflicted in a game by the player

Note: The scenario described here is completely hypothetical. This repository references the Player Unkowns Battle Ground (PUBG) game for illustrative purpose only.
